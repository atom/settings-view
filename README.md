## Usage
You can open the Settings View by navigating to _Edit > Preferences_ (Linux), _Atom > Preferences_ (OS X), or _File > Preferences_ (Windows).

In order to install new packages and themes, click on the _Install_ section on the left-hand side.
Once installed, community packages/themes and their settings are housed within their respective section.
All packages/themes that have updates will be listed under the _Updates_ section. Finally, all keybindings (including ones that community packages have added) are available in the _Keybindings_ section.

## Customize
The Settings View package uses the `ui-variables` to match a theme's color scheme. You can still customize the UI in your `styles.less` file. For example:

```css
// Change the color of the titles
.settings-view .section .section-heading {
  color: white;
}

// Change the font size of the setting descriptions
.settings-view .setting-description {
  font-size: 13px;
}
```
